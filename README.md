# Executive Summary/Abstract
Films are a unique form of human creative work, combining production processes and narrative storytelling in both audio and visual formats. These artistic creations reflect various aspects of human life and often strive to portray real-life conditions authentically. Creating films involves substantial time, cost, and effort, resulting in a diverse array of genres from fiction and nonfiction to action and adventure, catering to a broad audience. Technological advancements in film production have expanded the range of available films, attracting a growing audience eager to explore these cinematic works in theaters.

However, the vast selection of films available today makes it challenging for viewers to decide what to watch. To address this issue, we propose the development of a mobile application designed to recommend films tailored to individual preferences using machine learning algorithms. This app will enhance the user experience by incorporating a feature that allows users to compile lists of their all-time favorite movies. By analyzing these favorites, the machine learning algorithms within the app will detect underlying patterns and themes, such as preferred film styles and genres, enabling it to make personalized film recommendations. This approach not only simplifies the selection process but also enriches the viewing experience by connecting users with films that resonate with their individual tastes.

This observation stemmed from our personal experiences and from noticing that users often feel confused by the extensive options available. Simultaneously, advances in machine learning and data analytics have opened up new possibilities for personalized services. Our team recognized that integrating machine learning with mobile app technologies could effectively be applied to film recommendations based on individual preferences.
